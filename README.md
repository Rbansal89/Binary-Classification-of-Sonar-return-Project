# Binary-Classification-of-Sonar-return-Project
In this project I build a neural network which classifies the readings from the sonar as either a Rock is in front or a Mine.

The model achieved a mean accuracy of 87.07%
with standard deviation of 7.65
using a network containing single hidden layer of 60 neurons and one ouput layer of 1 neuron

The model with single hiddel layer of 30 neurons gave the following result
mean accuracy 84.19%
standard deviatoin 7.31
